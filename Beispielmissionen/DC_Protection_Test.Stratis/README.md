# Fungamer-2_DC_Protection

This FSM protects the players unit, in case they leave the server (involuntarily or not) from being killed. Particularly usefull for One-Life-Missions.

Please be mindful tho, that those units will remain invulnerable in case the player decides to leave early and no other player comes in to replace them. It is therefore highly advised to have a gamemaster present, that can make sure, this invulnerabilty does not lead to undesired mission outcomes.

## Future Plans

Turn the mission files into a working mod that does not have to be added to every mission
